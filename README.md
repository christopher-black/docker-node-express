## About This Repo

üåê We will be building a simple Express Server application for learning how "servers" and "clients" communicate using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/)!

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is a software created to make server-side programming with JavaScript possible. This allows developers to use the same language for both the frontend (what you see in your browser) and the backend (the server handling data and logic). This consistency can make development more efficient and streamline the process of building a web application.

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a web application framework for Node.js. It allows you to quickly create routes and APIs and handle requests and responses. With middleware and a minimalist structure, Express.js makes it easy to build fast and scalable web apps and services using Node.js.

## GitHub Setup

- [ ] **Create Repo from Use Template**:
  
  - Click [HERE](https://github.com/new?template_name=node-express-starter&template_owner=prime-digital-academy) or the `Use Template` button in this repo to create a new repo.
  - Ensure `Include all branches` is left unchecked.
  - Specify your username and repo name appropriately.
  - Provide a description for the repo (optional).
  - Set the repo as `Public`.
  - Click `Create repository`.

## Local Setup

- [ ] **Clone your Repo**:

  - Click the `<> Code` button in this repo and choose `SSH`.
  - Copy the URL. It should look something like: `git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git`.
  - In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone this repo.
  - Execute `git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git`, replacing the placeholders with actual values.

- [ ] **Initialize Node.js application in Repo**:

  - In the terminal, navigate to the folder you cloned this repo to and run the following to create a default `package.json` file:

    ```shell
    npm init -y
    ```

  > **NOTE:** Project names (when running `npm init` without the `--y`) can not have capital letters or spaces.

- [ ] **Install Express package**:

  - In the terminal, we need to install Express to use it:

    ```shell
    npm install express
    ```

## Instructions

You will be adding code to the `server.js` and the `client.js` files in your code to get your server and client both running.

> **NOTE:** The key combination `ctrl-c` will stop your server from running once you have it created and started. Whichever current Node.js process is running in that terminal will stop on macOS.

Follow along with your instructor to create a splendid Express Server application! Happy Priming!
